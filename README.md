Very Good (VG) Virtual Bank is the final project for my Web Applications & Services module.
It is written in Django templates using Phython language. There is an admin panel and a user panel.
Users can transfer, request, and receive money. They can also sign up to become a user and login using their credentials.
Admins can view and move money around user accounts and view and edit user profiles.
